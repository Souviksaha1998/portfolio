## 🎨 Customizing Content (The Easy Way)

**You do NOT need to touch the HTML code to update your info.**

1.  Open `js/data.js` in any text editor.
2.  You will see clear lists like:
    ```javascript
    export const skills = [
        "Python",
        "TensorFlow",
        "Computer Vision"
    ];
    ```
3.  Just add or remove items from the list, save the file, and refresh the page!
    - **Add a Skill**: Add `"New Skill",` to the list.
    - **Add a Project**: Copy-paste a project block and change the text.
